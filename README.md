# Assigning a Domain Name to a VM Instance  

A few days back I tried to map my VM's IP address to a domain name. Unfortunately my VM provider did not have a document that outlines the steps to do that (or in the spirit of sportsmanship, let's say it was difficult to find) . Their community had a few answers to the question but as with question-comment styled documents, there was no standard and in most comments, the detailing was not to the teeth. Luckily I found a slightly comprehensive post but i had to figure out a lot of things, so I decided the next Infrastructure Engineer shouldn't have to go through these.  

This repo contains guides on how to assign your domain name to an IP address. I'm accepting contributions so as to soften this task. Input about other domain name providers and various VM/cloud providers are also welcome.
