#### CONTRIBUTING GUIDE 
1. For every cloud provider or domain name provider, create your document in a README.md file of a **NEW FOLDER**.
2. Naming convention: The new folder should be named in this format: domain name provider + '-' + Cloud provider (TIP: look at previously named folders).
3. Take note of how long it took to map to your IP address and state it in your document. I'm collating the data, in the future i'll analyse it and we can say for sure exactly how long it takes.
4. Make your guide as descriptive as possible, state every step and clicks made.
